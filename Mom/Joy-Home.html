<h2>WHY?</h2>
<p>At just the right timing for me personally, my work had a meeting that included a discussion about why we do what we do.  The information discussed came from the book titled "Start with Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action" by Simon Sinek.  At this point I was starting to get into a bit of a slump.  Life comes with a list of tasks that need to be done..tasks that really are not happy and fun at all.  Laundry, dishes, my online job, driving my kids all over town for their activities, and making what feels like 100 meals a week are all on this list.  And honestly, I get tired of doing these things.  I'm sure you have a lengthy list of your own.  Sometimes, I get so mentally bogged down with how NOT FUN these tasks are (ie I throw myself a little pitty party) that I lose the big picture.  WHY do I do all of these tasks...day in and day out? 
After listening to the higher ups in my organization talk about remembering why we do what we do for our customers, I realized I need to zero in and define why I do what I do.  Perhaps this could bring a purpse to each load of laundry or violin lessons.  And perhaps it will refresh my willingness to put a little extra effort into a tastey and healthy meal for my family.  
I decided that my why is this:  I do what I do because I want to empower the members of my family (including myself) to live purposeful and joy-filled lives.  And now that I have that figured out, I need to take a hard look at the hows and whats of my life and determine if they align with my why. Knowing what brings my family joy and purpose will certainly be helpful.</p>

<h2>Henry and the Giant Tootsie Pop</h2>
<p>            Yesterday our family went to a park so the kids could ride their bikes and my husband and I could run on the beautiful trail.  The primary goal was for our five year old son to conquer riding his bike without training wheels.  Within 1 minute of trying, the kid was so overcome with fear that he got off his bike and sat on the ground.  So, I told him that was just fine.  We could just sit there for the next hour and wait for my daughter and husband to finish getting their exercise.  I explained that he would definitely be very safe and sound sitting there on the side of that path.  He had a zero percent chance of falling and getting hurt.  Or…he could get on that bike, even though he was scared, and act out of courage rather than fear.  He could explore the forest, go over bridges that crossed cool river rapids, and experience that joy of accomplishment.  There is the risk of falling.  But, it’s the only way to fully experience the forest.  Or, he could take no risk plan and stay super safe.  
            After a few moments he realized that it would not be fun to just sit there on the ground so he got back on his bicycle.  I’d love to tell you that he was so motivated by my awesome speech that he took off on his bike and never looked back.  But, he didn’t.  He kept going but he was so wobbly that I had to hold the back of his shirt to keep him from falling over.  The problem is that he wasn’t focusing on where he wanted to go or what he wanted to experience.  He focused on his fears.  I kept telling him that the faster he peddles, the easier it will be for him to balance.  Lots and lots of crying and whining ensued.  He didn’t quit.  But, I’m sure the people we passed on the trail thought I was the meanest mom ever because clearly I was getting frustrated.
            Then, I told him to look up at his sister who was way ahead and pretend that she is a giant Tootsie Pop.  His emotions turned from fear to laughing.  And his focus turned up and forward.  I yelled, “Peddle peddle peddle!  Go get that giant Tootsie Pop!” (And I ashamedly bribed him with a real tootsie pop when we got him if he was able to ride his bike with no help from me or help from training wheels.)  Well- by golly, it worked.  The kid flew through the forest.  He forgot his fears and went so fast I had to tell him to slow down so I could keep up with him.  And even when his bike slipped on some mud and he fell, he was so excited that he got right back on without a single tear.  
            Life is like riding a bike.  Sometimes, after realizing the risks involved, we choose to sit on the side and play it ultra safe.  Sometimes we get on, but we remain focused on our fears or problems, and we are wobbly.  And sometimes, we experience the fullness of life that can only be obtained when we get on that bike with our eyes set on where we want to go and we work hard to get there.  And sometimes, we will wipe out.  But, we don’t let that keep us down.  We do what we can with what we have and we focus on what brings us joy.
