<h1> <em>Our</em> Project Fish Tank</h1>
<P id = "h1folow-up"> When you first see <em>"Fish Tank Webpage",<br></em> you'd probably think of the normal "picture" fish tank,<br> but this is <strong>waaaay different.</strong> Our Project Fish Tank is special.<br> Keep reading this and the updates to find out why...</P>

<h2 class = "fishes" id = "1">Starting the object oriented fishes:</h2>
<p class = "fishes">First we practiced functions, <br>then we made them <em>object oriented</em>.<br> We copy-pasted the basic fish code from the challenge<br>
    into our fish prototype. We called the object<br> oriented function in a few of loops,<br>
    with randoms, and we did it inside a draw = function,
    <br> and it made our specified number of fish<br>
    in random spots on the screen, with random colors,<br>
    with random-ish sizes!

</p>

<h2 class = "fishO" id = "2">Making a fish ourselves:</h2>
<p class = "fishO">Making a fish ourself means, <strong>no more "basic fish code"<br>
    copy- pasting.
</strong>
    That fish code is much more confusing than<br> 
    the name implies. It is lots of turning hard coded numbers into variables, <br> and positioning/resizing with variables.<br>
    It is cool. <a href = "https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/fish-tank-redo-redo-redo-redo-redo/5723971979706368">Now, please, come see!</a>
</p>

<h2 class = "bezier-practice" id = "3"> Bezier practice:</h2>
<p class = "bezier-practice"> After we did the object oriented fishes,<br>
   we realized that we needed seaweed in our fish tank!<br>
   The only way to make the seaweed look the way we wanted,<br>
   was  to use beziers...
 Beziers were <em>much</em> more cornfusing than we thought.<br>
 We had to do: bezier(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4); !!!<br>
 So we decided to practice the beziers first.<br>
 five beziers a day, and they had to look like seaweed, <br>
 but with different colors and places.<br>
 <a href = "https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/seaweed-practice/5463259688599552">My first cool twist on beziers</a><br>
 <a href = "https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/seaweed-pracrice-redo/4509101959544832">My second bezier art program!</a>

    <h2 class = "seaweed-tail" id = "4">Seaweed and Fish Tail Flapping:</h2>
    <p class = "seaweed-tail"> 
        Our fish tank finally got seaweed,<br>
        by us doing what we did for the fish, but for seaweed, <br>
        and it was all on the bottom. They were all different lengths.<br>
        It looked really cool, but we thought it was missing movement.<br>
        <strong>These weren't fish <em>statues</em>!</strong><br>
        So, we made the tails flap at different rates with<br>
        some weird PI thing that I still don't completely understand.<br>
        All I know is that it was cool!<br>
        <a href = "https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/fish-tank-redo-redo-redo/6297359968763904">Go see my amazing tail flapping fish tank!</a>
