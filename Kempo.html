<h1>Kempo</h1>
<p>Hi!<br>
I do kempo, and I currently do kempo through Potomac Kempo. On this page, I'll put my katas and kempos!<br> 
Kempo is a form of karate, and kempos are made to attack one evil person, and katas are to attack multiple people, of my knowledge.<br>
There are ____ shaloin animals of kempo, and they are: Tiger, Leapoard, Crane, Dragon, and Snake.<br>
Tiger always attacks forward, Leapoard likes to dodge sideways and diagonally, Crane likes to duck and twist; make quick movements, <br>
Dragon likes to dissapear, and Snake likes to wrap around it's attacker. <br>
I've gotten a lot stronger with kempo because we have to do lots of excersizes. Here's a few exersizes we do:<br>
sit ups, push ups, roman soldiers, burpees, jumping jacks, piston push ups, mummy falls, water pumps, and laps around the dojo.<br>
All the kids in kempo wear geighs, which are our uniforms.<br>
We do kempo in our <i>dojo</i>. A dojo is a place where people practice karate.<br>
I hope yoy enjoy watching me do my kempo!
